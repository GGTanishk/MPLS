# MPLS
 Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a routing technique in telecommunications networks that directs data from one node to the next based on short path labels rather than long network addresses, thus avoiding complex lookups in a routing table and speeding traffic flows. The name “Multiprotocol” in the acronym is derived from the MPLS’ ability to possess the ability to encapsulate packets from various networking protocols. MPLS combines the performance and capabilities of Layer 2 (data link layer) switching with the proven scalability of Layer 3 (network layer) routing, thus giving itself a nickname, “Layer 2.5 protocol.”
